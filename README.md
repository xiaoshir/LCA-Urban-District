# LCA-Urban-District
A repository that supports LCA of an urban district

This repository contains:
- A documented unit process Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) in .xlsx format (Poppies LCI.xlsx), detailing data sources, assumptions, and interlinkages between unit processes.
- LCA analytical workflows implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Brightway2 (Analysis for Poppies.ipynb), which imports and processes the Excel-based LCI data.
- A set of interactive visualisations (in .html format) generated from the notebook to explore and communicate the LCA results for an urban district under folder "html result figures" (results for Poppies as included in the project deliverable for ATELIER "D9.2.1 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Poppies â€“ a case study applying an LCA tool for Positive Energy Districts (PEDs)" are included).
- A .yml file that specifies the packages installed in the environment where this analysis was carried out (atelier_environment.yml).
