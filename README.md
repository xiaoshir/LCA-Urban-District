# LCA-Urban-District
A repository that supports LCA of an urban district

This repository contains:
- A documented unit process Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) in .xlsx format, detailing data sources, assumptions, and interlinkages between unit processes.
- LCA analytical workflows implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Brightway2, which imports and processes the Excel-based LCI data.
- A set of interactive visualisations (in .html format) generated from the notebook to explore and communicate the LCA results for an urban district.
